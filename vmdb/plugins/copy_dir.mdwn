Step: copy-dir
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursively copy a directory from outside into the target filesystem.

Step keys:

* `copy-dir` &mdash; REQUIRED; the full (starting from the new
  filesystem root) path of directory to copy to. Any missing
  directories will be created with the configured user and group ownership and
  permissions. See the `perm`, `uid`, `gid`, `user` and `group` keys.
* `src` &mdash; REQUIRED; the path of the directory to copy from on the host
  filesystem, outside the chroot, relative to the current working directory of
  the vmdb2 process.
* `perm` &mdash; OPTIONAL; the permissions to apply to any missing parent
  directories that are created on the target. The value of `umask` is applied
  to this value.
* `umask` &mdash; OPTIONAL; the numeric (octal) representation of umask to
  apply to the permissions of copied files and directories. Defaults to 0022.
* `uid` &mdash; OPTIONAL; the numeric user ID to assign to the copied files
  and directories. Defaults to 0 (root).
* `gid` &mdash; OPTIONAL; the numeric group ID to assign to the copied files
  and directories. Defaults to 0 (root).
