Step: qemu-debootstrap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This command has been merged into `debootstrap`.
If your builds run on Debian 10 or later,
it is recommended to use `debootstrap` instead of `qemu-debootstrap`.

Install packages using apt, which needs to already have been
installed, for a different architecture than the host where vmdb2 is
being run. For example, for building an image for a Raspberry Pi on an
Intel PC.

Step keys:

* `qemu-debootstrap` &mdash; REQUIRED; value is the codename of the Debian
  release to install: `stretch`, `buster`, etc.

* `target` &mdash; REQUIRED; value is the tag for the root filesystem.

* `mirror` &mdash; OPTIONAL; which Debian mirror to use.

* `keyring` &mdash; OPTIONAL; which gpg keyring to use to verify the
  packages. This is useful when using a non-official Debian repository
  (e.g. Raspbian) as by default qemu-debootstrap will use the keys
  provided by the "debian-archive-keyring" package.

* `arch` &mdash; REQUIRED; the foreign architecture to use.

* `variant` &mdash; OPTIONAL; the variant for debootstrap.

Example (in the .vmdb file):

    - qemu-debootstrap: buster
      target: root
      mirror: http://mirror.example.com/debian
      keyring: /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
      arch: arm64
      variant: buildd
